Comparing the execution time of the C & Python programs

C has taken  3.7s and Python took  205.1s to complete the same task 
Reason : 
C used a Compiler and Python uses a interpreter, so compiler would translate the high language code into machine code which executes directly on CPU whereas interpreter would execute statements line by line hence takes time more time.

When used numpy library's built in methods the time has drastically fallen to 2.7s because the library is written in 
highly optimised C code which made it 75x faster.
It make use of vectorization and cache  benifits.

When we use different optmisation levels like O2 and O3 the time taken is less than the numpy library usage i.e around ~1.1s.
When used these flags it does the things like dead code elimination, altering the order of instructions and vectorization.
Important distinction is that for O2 and O3 flags there is no sys time used.
